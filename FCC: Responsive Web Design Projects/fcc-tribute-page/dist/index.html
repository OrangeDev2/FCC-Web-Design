    Tom Threepersons was a Cherokee lawman. He is considered to have been one of the last of what were considered gunfighters of the Old West, although his career did not begin until the early 20th century. He invented the "Tom Threepersons holster." Learn more about <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Threepersons" target="_blank">Tom Threepersons</a>.
